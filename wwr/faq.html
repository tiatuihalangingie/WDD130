        <h1 class="headline">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h4 class="Q1">Is this a good trip for kids? 
            What are the age ranges you allow?</h4>
        <p class="A1">Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages.
             We have found however that children over the age of 8 
             seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially 
             enjoy it more if their children are all over 8).</p>

        <h4 class="Q2">Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim!
             Can I still come?</h4>
        <p class="A2">To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness
             First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common
              injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.</p>

        <h4 class="Q5">What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?<br></h4>
        <p class="A5">Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the river.
            Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky
            After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to bed 
            under more stars than you thought were possible.</p>
        <img class="river-five" src="images/rafting58_600.jpg">
        <h4 class="Q6">How far in advance should I book my trip?</h4>
        <p class="A6">If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.</p>
