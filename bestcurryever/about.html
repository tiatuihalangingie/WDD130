        <h2 class="love">Motivated by love</h2>
        <p class="para1">Keke" and "Pai" was the main reason that inspired me to start the
             "Best Curry Ever take-out." "Keke" and "Pai" are our family's desserts back on 
             the Island of Tonga. Since we moved here to the States, there were times I noticed
              my parents craved the keke. "Pai" was okay because I got the recipe from my 
              Grandmother. I can make it easy whenever my parents crave it. But the "Keke" 
              we usually buy it, but it doesn't taste how we like it. So,  I was motivated 
              to make it from scratch to the point I mastered it. I got the curry recipe 
              from my Mother. She always loved it when I made it for her. 'Otai is our family's 
              favorite drink of all time.

        <h2 class="inspiration">My Inspiration</h2>
        <p class="para2">My parents are my great inspiration in learning how to cook these meals. I am so grateful for them.
            I gained these incredible experiences because of them. Because my parents enjoy these foods so much, I
             knew that some people out there must have craved them too, especially the Polynesian people, so I started 
             selling them. I hope everyone who came and those who might stop by will enjoy these meals. I was touched by
              love to bake and cook what my parents love to eat. So, It is a privilege to share this food with the world. 
              These great inspirations became my talents. Something that I love to do. It makes me happy when I see the 
              customers enjoy their meals.</p>
