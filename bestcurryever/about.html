        <p class="para1">"Keke" and "Pai" was the main reason that inspired me to start the "Best Curry Ever take-out." 
            "Keke" and "Pai" are our family's desserts back on the Island of Tonga. There were many times 
            I noticed my parents craved them. We usually buy them, but they don't fit how we like them. 
            I got the "Pai" recipe from my Grandmother. One of the things I never knew I could ever bake 
            in a million's years. But the"keke," I was motivated to make it from scratch to the point I mastered
             it. The curry was my mother's recipe. 'Otai is our family's favorite drink of all time. </p>

        <p class="para2">My parents are my great inspiration in learning how to cook these meals. I am so grateful for them.
            I gained these incredible experiences because of them. Because my parents enjoy these foods so much, I
             knew that some people out there must have craved them too, especially the Polynesian people, so I started 
             selling them. I hope everyone who came and those who might stop by will enjoy these meals. I was touched by
              love to bake and cook what my parents love to eat. So, It is a privilege to share this food with the world. 
              These great inspirations became my talents. Something that I love to do. It makes me happy when I see the 
              customers enjoy their meals.</p>
