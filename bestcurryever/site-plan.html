        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The "Best Curry Ever take-out" goal is to welcome and introduce
         visitors to what "Best Curry Ever take-out" is all about. The name 
         itself distracted the visitors to check it out. It will be much easier 
         for the customer to excess online, especially if they want to order their 
         curry in a hurry and not want to go and stand waiting in line or go home and 
         cook. Most of the customers are last-minute pick up because of that very reason.  

        <br><br>This site must have a distracting look that suits the take-out. The homepage's
         color, font, images, and settings of the page must be more revealing and look legit.
          The images must be clear and match the take-out. If they enjoy the site's looks, it 
          might give them more reason to be willing to check curry out in person.<br>

         <br>There will be a space that will share the benefit of the curry. For example, the tumeric
          may reduce inflammation in the body. Ginger treats upset stomachs, headaches, and infections. 
          Garlic also has anti-inflammatory properties, which have been proven trusted sources to ease arthritis
           symptoms.

        Best Curry Ever take-out has two types of curry. The First curry is lamb curry,
         and the second is chicken curry. There are two sides to eat with the curry. It is 
         either they pick to eat it with rice or Tapioca. In addition, there will be two deserts. 
         The first dessert is called "Keke." They can eat it with jam, Nutella, peanut butter, 
         or by itself. The other dessert is called "Pai." It is a rolled pie with jam. Again, 
         the customer can pick and choose what they want intside the pie. It is either pineapple, 
         papaya, raspberry, or strawberry jam. It is super delicious. There are also two types of 
         drinks called "'Otai." The first Otai is called "Watermelon 'Otai" made with watermelon 
         and pineapple, and the second 'Otai is called "Mango 'Otai" made with mango and pineapple. 
         These are the menus at the moment, but I will add more menus later as the take-out goes on.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        "Best Curry Ever" came from the customers. That was their feedback every time they 
        bought the curry. Therefore, that is where I got our "Best Curry Ever take-out" name.
         "Keke" and "Pai" was the main reason that inspired me to start the "Best Curry Ever take-out." 
         "Keke" and "Pai" are our family's desserts back on the Island of Tonga. There were many times 
         I noticed my parents craved them. We usually buy them, but they don't fit how we like them. 
         I got the "Pai" recipe from my Grandmother. One of the things I never knew I could ever bake 
         in a million's years. But the"keke," I was motivated to make it from scratch to the point I mastered
          it. The curry was my mother's recipe. 'Otai is our family's favorite drink of all time. 

        <br>My parents are my great inspiration in learning how to cook these meals. I am so grateful for them.
         I gained these incredible experiences because of them. Because my parents enjoy these foods so much, I
          knew that some people out there must have craved them too, especially the Polynesian people, so I started 
          selling them. I hope everyone who came and those who might stop by will enjoy these meals. I was touched by
           love to bake and cook what my parents love to eat. So, It is a privilege to share this food with the world. 
           These great inspirations became my talents. Something that I love to do. It makes me happy when I see the 
           customers enjoy their meals.
